<p><strong>About the mod</strong></p>

<p>This mod automatically unlocks all achievements associated with the "Pale Reach" DLC in the game. When the player is not docked, the plugin checks each achievement from the DLC. If any of these achievements are not yet unlocked, the plugin sets their state to unlocked, ensuring that all the associated achievements are granted to the player. This mod is straightforward and ensures players can instantly receive all achievements from the specified DLC.</p>
